        ### Understanding Losing Streaks
        
        Consecutive losses are natural in trading but should be monitored:
        - **1-3 losses:** Normal market fluctuation
        - **4-6 losses:** Review strategy and risk management
        - **7+ losses:** Consider reducing position size or taking a break
        
        ### Streak Management Tips
        - Set maximum consecutive loss limits
        - Reduce position size after 3+ losses
        - Review strategy after unusual streaks
